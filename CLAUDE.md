## Technical Implementation Plan

### Immediate PoC Web Interface

**Technology Stack**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React (fast deployment to Vercel)
- **Backend**: FastAPI wrapper around existing Python code
- **Database**: SQLite for user sessions and feedback
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend)

**File Structure**:
```
web/
├── frontend/          # Next.js app
