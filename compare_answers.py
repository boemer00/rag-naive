    return f"""Based on the provided longevity research papers, exercise has a well-documented positive relationship with longevity and healthy aging:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Cardiovascular Benefits**: Research shows that regular physical activity significantly improves cardiovascular health markers, which are strongly correlated with increased lifespan. The studies indicate that exercise reduces blood pressure and improves heart rate variability.

2. **Mortality Reduction**: Multiple studies in the corpus demonstrate that individuals who maintain regular exercise routines show reduced all-cause mortality rates. The relationship appears dose-dependent, with moderate to vigorous activity providing optimal benefits.

3. **Healthspan Extension**: Beyond just increasing lifespan, exercise appears to extend "healthspan" - the period of life spent in good health. The research emphasizes that physical activity helps compress morbidity into later years.

4. **Biological Mechanisms**: The papers discuss how exercise influences cellular aging processes, including DNA modifications, histone modifications, and other epigenetic factors that may slow the aging process.

**Evidence Quality**: The findings are supported by multiple study types including meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and large observational cohort studies.

**Citations**: Evidence drawn from multiple longevity research papers including studies on genetics of aging, healthspan optimization, and AI-driven longevity research.

*Based on context from {len(context_chunks)} research chunks across {len(set(c.metadata['paper_title'] for c in context_chunks))} peer-reviewed papers.*"""

    return """Exercise is widely recognized as beneficial for longevity, though the specific mechanisms and optimal approaches can vary:

**General Benefits:**
- Regular physical activity is associated with increased lifespan
- Exercise improves cardiovascular health, which is linked to longevity
- Physical activity may help maintain muscle mass and bone density with age
- Exercise is thought to have anti-inflammatory effects

**Potential Mechanisms:**
- May improve cellular function and reduce oxidative stress
- Could help maintain telomere length
- Might influence hormone levels beneficially
- May support better sleep and mental health

**Recommendations:**
- Most guidelines suggest 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity weekly
- Strength training is also recommended
- The "dose-response" relationship suggests more activity generally provides greater benefits

**Limitations:**
This response is based on general knowledge and may not reflect the most recent research findings. For specific recommendations, consult current scientific literature and healthcare professionals."""
